After my dad passes I'm becoming 501 charitable organization to avoid property taxes. My home is paid for. I'm not funding the university anymore because of lack of access to academic journals. I don't fund the market anymore because you can't make more than $100 in 6-month income on a $10K investment it is just debt and funding companies. I support the bank on a federal banking law of a $2 Million ETF.  I have $5 Million in Real Estate vouchers and a $30 Billion Microsoft Tender Offer. I'm debt free.

 I stay at home because of the oil crisis. I wanted castles in America and I didn't approve of colonial architecture. I support Daniel Quinn on Population Law. I don't support the supreme court cases Virginia V. Loving and Same Sex Marriage. According to public education law college graduation requirements are 8 semesters. I've gone 18 and scored a 24 on the ACT. I don't support the government and support government shutdown because of break fix contracts. I believe in postmodernism and universities should just shutdown or work on the Pentagon's JEDI contract. 

Me and the actress Anne Hathaway share a compatible astrological, biological, educational, gerontological and psychological components. Which is backed by ELIZA the chatbot 1960s at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum. I stand with Dr. Steven Hawking and his belief in deity. I am a ethical engineer and a guardian deity. I stand with Pope Francis on the acceptance of evolution and the big bang.

In 2025 I signed a NDA with the Actress Anne Hathaway and received $99k worth of funding from one of her fans or Hollywood executive.

I support the Catholic Church and the book of Revelation in saying going back and marrying your first soul mate. I have my Diplomatic Immunity through a Royal Society Special Bilateral Agreement.

Believe it or not the bank is your friend and I threw my Nine Inch Nails away. 

Through Macromedia I'm supported by the Pentagon.
