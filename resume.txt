ABOUT ME

I have a driver’s license

I have a security clearance

Spoke with Microsoft Legal about indenity theft in my community and in Hollywood and the Virginia Joint Commission for discrimination and misdiagnosis, and missed opportunity at Stanford and Harvard University because of community service board employees in Virginia at Microsoft Legal. I've also spoke with Microsoft Legal about my normal contrast MRI and lawsuit against Morgan Maclure racing and SWVAMHI Dr. Barash.

Microsoft can keep there company if they work on their relationship with Component Source and Open Source Collaboration sites where I work. If Bill Gates wants a PC in every home he's going to have to stop supporting President Nixion which my family never did and work on population law otherwise it's Communism (or accounting course chosen companies to invest in) and Computers from the Carter Era. America is still not in the Commonwealth of nations and buys too many things.

Also housing discrimination against a Royal Society of the Arts lifetime fellow and career negligence on the part of the democratic party. I paid my tuition, I did not qualify for the Pell Grant my EFC was to high and my family pays its real estate taxes we expect the academic journals to be avaible to the homeowner. As much as we pay for internet service. Over $150 a month. I'm giving cash $3K to my father for a local lawyer's fee's soon he is about to go into a nursing home in five years or less. I'm inheriting one home and I rent. When I was furniture porter I paid for my families dinning room suit and living room. Now I rent and I've paid for everything in my apt. Including the den and bedroom suit and office equipment.

Letters of recomendation from Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates, CEO Steve Ballmer and President Brack Obama

Played my last show for 7 years Pearl Jam's 'Thin Air' Wasn't played.
